# kssb-menu
The landing (and initial) repo for development of KSSB Menu, a scraper of the breakfast, lunch and dinner menus at the [Kansas State School for the Blind](https://kansasblind.gov).

You can read about it in full (including reasons for development in text and audio formats) in [Patrick Wilson's TEALS Student Spotlight](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/teals-student-spotlight-patrick-wilson-overland-park-ks)

## Credits
The following people helped make this happen:
* [Síle Ekaterin Liszka](https://github.com/VulpineAmethyst) for helping me learn how to parse Wordpress pages.

## Other Associated Projects
There are two (as of this writing) additional projects I made based on this code; I used it to help me learn how to use the information given.
* [KSSB Menu API](https://github.com/kssb-cc/kssb-menu-api) - A program that uses Flask to provide an interface for including the KSSB menu in your applications.
* [KSSB Menu Telegram](https://github.com/kssb-cc/kssb-menu-telegram) - a bot designed to run on a server and send users the menu as requested.

I hope you enjoyed my work! Feel free to improve this code; I was just learning Python and I trust there is stuff I could fix.
