# kssb-menu
Scrape the KSSB food menu.

The goal of this project is to allow someone to supply a day, and you will get whatever is on the menu for that day.

I also want to set this thing up so it can run on my server and 'ding' me with whatever is on the menu for that day. Maybe I can charge people for this service too. :).

## What we can do so far
* Get the page itself.
* Find the class the menu items themselves are in. Wordpress does some good after all!
* The menu prints now (including its items).

## What still must be done
* Do something with that information (ask the user for a day, etc). This is being done in the Telegram repo.
